# APS Diglib Migration Scripts

These scripts were written to help migrate data from the American Philosophical Society's legacy installation of Islandora to Islandora 2.0. They were written to clean data from the legacy format to the new format and were not written with best standards of code quality and reuse in mind.

They are provided as-is in the hopes that they may help other small institutions with their migrations.
