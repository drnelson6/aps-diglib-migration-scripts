# APS Diglib Migration Scripts

These scripts were written to help migrate data from the American Philosophical Society's legacy installation of Islandora to Islandora 2.0. They were written to clean data from the legacy MODS format to the new Drupal database format and were not written with best standards of code quality and reuse in mind. As they depend on the APS's data model, the extent to which they can be reused may be limited.

They are provided as-is in the hopes that they may help other small institutions with their migrations.
